# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.11.0-beta+120100] - 2026-08-25

### Changed

* TOC: updated the interface version to `120100` for WoW 12.1 retail.
* Quest Info: use `Enum.QuestClassification.Legendary` and `C_QuestLog.IsRepeatableQuest` directly instead of the APIs removed in WoW 12.0.

### Fixed

* World Map: only install secure hooks when the corresponding Blizzard mixin and method are available. This prevents addon initialization errors when 12.1's refactored load-on-demand UI has not created an optional pin mixin.

## [0.10.3-beta+120005] - 2026-04-30

### Changed

* TOC: updated interface version to `120005` for current WoW 12.0.5 retail patch.

### Fixed

* Quest Pin: fixed Lua error `attempt to index a nil value` in `UpdateWorldMapPinQuestInfo` — `ns.activeZoneMapInfo` could still be `nil` when a quest pin tooltip was triggered before the world map data provider had initialized it. Added a fallback to the player's current map info and a nil-guard on the area comparison (`Core.lua`).

## [0.10.2a-beta+120001] - 2026-03-29

### Fixed

* Tooltip: fixed Lua errors caused by WoW taint system marking frame dimension values as "secret numbers" — `GameTooltip:GetWidth()` and similar API calls could return tainted values after addon interaction, causing arithmetic and comparison failures. Added `SafeNumber()` wrapper (`tonumber(tostring(value))`) to sanitize tainted values before use in tooltip width calculations (`Core.lua`).

## [0.10.1-beta+120001] - 2026-02-20

### Changed

* TOC: updated interface version to `120001` to support WoW 12.0 (and HandyNotes 12.0).

### Fixed

* Quest Info: fixed Lua errors caused by `C_QuestLog.IsLegendaryQuest` being removed in WoW 12.0 — added nil-check guard before calling the function (`Core.lua`, `data/questinfo.lua`).
* Quest Info: fixed Lua errors caused by `C_QuestLog.IsRepeatableQuest` being removed in WoW 12.0 — added nil-check guard before calling the function (`Core.lua`, `data/questinfo.lua`).
* Quest Info: fixed Lua errors caused by `C_QuestLog.IsQuestRepeatableType` being removed in WoW 12.0 — added nil-check guard before calling the function (`data/questinfo.lua`).

## [0.10.0-beta+110002] - 2024-09-20

* Tooltip: adjusted quest tooltip width - tooltips with shorter content will now be stretched to fit the game's default tooltip.

### Fixed

* Tooltip: due to the many changes recently, when deactivating one or more content categories in settings superfluous spacing appeared in the main tooltip.
* Quest Type Tags: important quests showed both old- and new-style tags in the tooltip.
* Notifications: when earning an achievement criteria the counter was off by 1 since the achievement cache wasn't reset.
